Classifying Stack Exchange topics.

The training set contains posts from arduino.stackexchange.com labelled as hardware or software. 3 models are used to classify them into hardware or software. Grid Search CV is used to find the optimal parameters for the models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to Visualize the data after vectorization. Cross validation is used to evaluate the performance using train test split. Validation Curves are plotted to validate the performance results.
